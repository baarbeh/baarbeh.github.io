This is one of my favourite pictures. I took it on a beautiful October evening in Madrid. I had arrived in the city early that morning and had been fighting jet lag all day. I only had a few days to explore the city so I forced myself to get out. I wasn't sure where I was going, but I read online that the [Tempolo de Debod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Debod) was the place to see the sun set in Madrid. 

I was surprised by how many people were there. The temple itself is gorgeous, an Egyptian temple that was brought to Spain and reconstructed in the 1970s. I met a few groups of tourists and one group offered to take my picture. 

As the sun set everyone gathered to catch that golden moment. I found a spot to sit on the ledge of the pond. For a few minutes everyone was caught up in the magic of an event that happens every day. As I framed the shot a couple stood out from the crowd to get a view across the valley. Their hug framed perfectly by the sun. 

The moment passed quickly and it began it get dark. Tourists continued sightseeing, yogis wrapped their meditations and the LARPers got out their lightsabers. For that brief moment hundreds of people broke from their routine and found a connection. 

In a few weeks I'll be flying to Nairobi, Kenya to do research on how makerspaces and tech hubs are fostering innovation. While there I will be posting a short daily blog of my experiences. I'm looking forward to breaking from my routine and making new friends while I'm there. 

Innovation is about approaching problems from new perspectives. I'm excited to see how Kenyan entrepreneurs are bringing new ideas and developing solutions to local and global problems.
